# PSI Changelog 

- Nov 5, 2023 : 11:59 - New Github ID `md-127` with paw `127PCL` opened. New Repo created : clmd (short for change log in markdown format). This file is saved there as `2023-11-05-psi_changelog.md`. Each time something changes here in the **MultiTabs Markdown Editor** (Chrome Extension), the `save to` button needs to be clicked, the repo selected in the github file save dialog and the consequent github query replied to. Tedious Process (However the shortcut <kbd> Ctrl + S</kbd> works).

This editor only works in Chrome (I think it is one of the editors which make editing markdown files easier for githab, _but you still have to know the basic codes_  expect nothing fancy here.) For me, it is the ability to save / recall this file from a web space is all what matters. Note that this repo is a public one and is theoretically discoverable by just about anyone.  
    -  **Check** whether edits can be continued from another Chrome profile.  Yes it does. Tested it from my sxccal profile. Install this extension, Import from Github login as `md-127` to Github and everything seems to work out.
