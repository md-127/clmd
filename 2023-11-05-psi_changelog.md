# PSI-127 Changelog 

## Journal Entries

### Topics

#### Linux

- 20231104 `@127PCL` It seems that there exist no simple ways to capture urls or create app shortcuts in linux. You can drag a `.desktop` file or create a link using the `ln` command, but urls cannot be dragged from browser tags the way we do it in windows). Markdown comes to rescue, though. In some ways it is even better as one can attach comments, include math, embed a picture to websites or folder paths. 
- Typing Automation/Text Expansion in Linux: Seems that espanso is the only serious option as I could not put run lintalist in linux(but it works in linux). But there _is_ a project called lintalist4linux which I have checked a few times: everytime something goes wrong. 
- [GitHub - eschluntz/compress: Text compression for generating keyboard expansions](https://github.com/eschluntz/compress) 



### Nov 5, 2023 : 11:59 

New Github ID `md-127` with paw `127PCL` opened from 127PCL G. New Repo created : `clmd` (short for change log in markdown format). This file is saved there as `2023-11-05-psi_changelog.md`. Each time something changes here in the **MultiTabs Markdown Editor** (Chrome Extension), the `save to` button needs to be clicked (see fig. below), the repo selected in the github file save dialog, and the consequent github query replied to. Admittedly a tedious Process (However the shortcut <kbd> Ctrl + S</kbd> works to reduce the tedium by a tad bit)

My purpose here,  is to have the the ability to save / recall this file from the github cloud from any device which runs the chrome browser so that I can retrace my steps from just about anywhere. 

**Be Warned** this repo is a public one and is theoretically _discoverable by just about anyone_. I tried to create a private repo too, but this app cannnot access anything from there.

This editor only works in Chrome (I think it is one of the editors which make editing markdown files easier for githab, _but you still have to know the basic codes_  expect nothing fancy here.)
    -  **Check** whether edits can be continued from another Chrome profile.  Yes it does. Tested it from my sxccal profile. Install this extension, Import from Github login as `md-127` to Github and everything seems to work out (but the file needs to be imported again if the chrome profile is switched, sync is not automatic, not does it happen with browser refresh)
